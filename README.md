# Image-classification

The main problem of my project is recognition boat’s type. In my dataset I have different types of boat’s image, for example dishes in the form of boat. I think, it is interesting to fit the model to classify this dish as “gondola” class. Mostly, all of boats look similar to each other and it would be useful to construct model to classify them.
